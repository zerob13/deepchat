# Release Flow

This document defines the maintainer release flow for DeepChat without rewriting existing `dev` / `main` history.

## Goals

- Keep `dev` as the only long-lived integration branch.
- Keep `main` as a stable mirror of reviewed release commits.
- Keep releases tag-driven through [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml).
- Avoid creating new merge commits on `main`.

## Branch Roles

- `dev`: active development and integration branch.
- `main`: stable mirror of released source snapshots.
- `release/<version>`: short-lived review branch cut from an existing commit on `dev`.

`release/<version>` must not carry release-only commits. If a release fix is required, land it on `dev` first and then move the release branch forward to the updated `dev` commit.

## Standard Release Sequence

1. Prepare release metadata on `dev`.

   - Update the version, `CHANGELOG.md`, and any release notes on `dev`.
   - Run the required local checks before cutting a release branch.

2. Cut the review branch from the release-ready commit on `dev`.

   ```bash
   git switch dev
   git pull --ff-only origin dev
   git switch -c release/v1.0.0-beta.4
   git push -u origin release/v1.0.0-beta.4
   ```

3. Open a PR from `release/<version>` to `main`.

   - The PR exists for review and CI only.
   - Do not use the GitHub merge button to land the PR.
   - Do not click "Update branch" on the PR, because it creates new merge commits.

4. If review finds a release issue, fix it on `dev` first.

   ```bash
   git switch dev
   git pull --ff-only origin dev
   # land the release fix on dev
   git branch -f release/v1.0.0-beta.4 origin/dev
   git switch release/v1.0.0-beta.4
   git push --force-with-lease origin release/v1.0.0-beta.4
   ```

   Use `--force-with-lease` only because the release branch is a disposable review branch that must stay identical to a commit already on `dev`.

5. After the PR is approved, fast-forward `main` locally on macOS or Linux.

   ```bash
   pnpm run release:ff -- release/v1.0.0-beta.4 --tag v1.0.0-beta.4
   ```

   The helper script validates:

   - the working tree is clean
   - the target release commit already exists on `origin/dev`
   - `origin/main` is an ancestor of the target commit
   - `main` can be updated with `git merge --ff-only`
   - the requested tag is free locally and on `origin`

   The `--tag` option validates tag availability and prints the tag command. Create and push the
   tag in the next step.

   Windows maintainers should skip this helper and use the manual release sequence below.

6. Create and push the release tag on the same commit.

   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0-beta.4 release/v1.0.0-beta.4
   git push origin v1.0.0-beta.4
   ```

7. Delete the temporary release branch after the release is published.

   ```bash
   git push origin --delete release/v1.0.0-beta.4
   git branch -d release/v1.0.0-beta.4
   ```

## Manual Release Sequence

Use this sequence when the automatic helper is unavailable, especially on Windows. It updates `origin/main` directly from the reviewed release commit and does not depend on the state of your local `main`.

1. Fetch the latest release refs.

   ```bash
   git fetch origin main dev --prune
   ```

2. Resolve the reviewed release commit and record it as `TARGET_SHA`.

   ```bash
   git rev-parse origin/release/v1.0.0-beta.4^{commit}
   # or
   git rev-parse release/v1.0.0-beta.4^{commit}
   # or
   git rev-parse <target-ref>^{commit}
   ```

3. Confirm the release commit already exists on `origin/dev`.

   ```bash
   git merge-base --is-ancestor <TARGET_SHA> origin/dev
   ```

4. Confirm `origin/main` can be fast-forwarded to the reviewed release commit.

   ```bash
   git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main <TARGET_SHA>
   ```

5. Confirm the release tag does not already exist locally or on `origin`.

   ```bash
   git rev-parse --verify --quiet refs/tags/v1.0.0-beta.4
   git ls-remote --exit-code --tags origin refs/tags/v1.0.0-beta.4
   ```

   Both commands should report that the tag is missing before you continue.

6. Fast-forward `origin/main` directly to the reviewed release commit.

   ```bash
   git push origin <TARGET_SHA>:refs/heads/main
   ```

7. Create and push the release tag on the same commit.

   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0-beta.4 <TARGET_SHA>
   git push origin refs/tags/v1.0.0-beta.4
   ```

8. Delete the temporary release branch after the release is published.

   ```bash
   git push origin --delete release/v1.0.0-beta.4
   git branch -d release/v1.0.0-beta.4
   ```

## Repository Settings

These settings are not stored in the repository and must be configured manually on GitHub:

- Enable **Require linear history** on `main`.
- Keep PR checks required for PRs targeting `main` and `dev`.
- Allow maintainers to push `main` only through the documented `ff-only` procedure.
- Treat the PR merge button for `main` as disabled by policy, even if the repository UI still shows it.

## CI Guardrails

- PRs targeting `main` must come from `release/<version>` branches.
- The head commit of a PR targeting `main` must already be contained in `origin/dev`.
- Release tags must point to commits that are already reachable from `origin/main`.

Release workflows keep Windows `x64` and `arm64` as distinct targets. Windows ARM64 uses the
`build:win:arm64` script, installs only runtime payloads available for `win32/arm64`, and packages only
plugins whose manifest declares that target. Artifact names and update metadata must retain architecture so
an ARM64 build cannot replace or be served as an x64 package. The equivalent platform/architecture contract
for bundled plugins is documented in [plugin packaging](./guides/plugin-packaging.md).

These rules are enforced in the repository workflows so the documented flow and the automation stay aligned.

## History Hygiene

Use first-parent history for day-to-day inspection:

```bash
git log --oneline --decorate --first-parent dev -n 30
git log --oneline --decorate --first-parent main -n 30
```

Avoid using `git log --all --decorate --graph` as the default project view because old release merges and stale branch refs make it noisier than the actual mainline history.

Clean up short-lived branches after they are merged:

```bash
git fetch --prune origin
git branch --merged dev
```
