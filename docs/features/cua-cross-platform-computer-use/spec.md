# CUA Cross-Platform Computer Use Spec

## Status

Draft for implementation planning.

## Background

DeepChat currently ships the CUA computer-use capability as an official plugin under
`plugins/cua`. The integration is DeepChat-managed: the plugin declares a skill and a bundled
tool server that DeepChat starts internally. Users do not configure an external MCP server, install
the CUA driver manually, or rely on PATH for the bundled experience.

The current plugin is macOS-only:

- `plugins/cua/plugin.json` limits `engines.platforms` to `darwin`.
- The runtime build script builds the older Swift driver from the vendored CUA fork.
- The package script special-cases only `runtime/darwin/<arch>`.
- Build and release workflows only include the CUA plugin in macOS artifacts.
- Skill docs, runtime permission wording, tests, and packaging docs assume macOS.

Upstream `trycua/cua` now publishes the Rust CUA driver as cross-platform release artifacts. The
latest verified driver release for this plan is `cua-driver-rs-v0.7.1`, published on
2026-07-07. DeepChat support for this feature is limited to the targets that have upstream release
assets and have been validated for bundled plugin packaging:

- macOS arm64 and x86_64, plus universal variants.
- Windows x86_64 and arm64.
- Linux x86_64.

Linux arm64 remains unsupported for this DeepChat integration until upstream publishes and DeepChat
validates a matching release asset. Upstream documents Linux support as pre-release. DeepChat should
expose Linux support where the runtime asset exists, while keeping Linux limitations explicit in
docs and validation.

## Goal

Update the official DeepChat CUA plugin from the older macOS-only driver integration to the latest
cross-platform upstream CUA driver release, so packaged DeepChat builds can use computer-use tools
on macOS, Windows, and Linux without requiring user-managed MCP setup or manual CUA installation.

## Non-Goals

- Do not switch DeepChat to user-managed MCP configuration for CUA.
- Do not require PATH-installed `cua-driver` for the bundled plugin.
- Do not run upstream install or uninstall scripts at app runtime.
- Do not introduce auto-start services, scheduled tasks, or package-manager installation from
  inside DeepChat.
- Do not claim Linux arm64 CUA support until that target is explicitly validated for DeepChat
  packaging.
- Do not redesign the plugin host or the global tool permission model.

## Platform Scope

The implementation must support these packaged plugin targets:

| DeepChat platform | DeepChat arch | Upstream asset status | Required behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `darwin` | `arm64` | Available | Bundle and verify CUA runtime |
| `darwin` | `x64` | Available | Bundle and verify CUA runtime |
| `win32` | `x64` | Available | Bundle and verify CUA runtime |
| `win32` | `arm64` | Available | Bundle and verify CUA runtime |
| `linux` | `x64` | Available | Bundle and verify CUA runtime |
| `linux` | `arm64` | Unsupported for DeepChat | Do not bundle or show CUA; fail clearly if requested directly |

## Visibility Scope

CUA support is target-based, not only platform-based. The plugin must be visible only for these
runtime targets:

- `darwin/arm64`
- `darwin/x64`
- `win32/x64`
- `win32/arm64`
- `linux/x64`

The plugin must not be visible as an official usable plugin on:

- `linux/arm64`

If the current plugin manifest can only express platform support, implementation must add an
arch-aware gate through manifest metadata, official-plugin discovery, or runtime support checks.
`engines.platforms` alone is not sufficient for CUA because Linux arm64 must stay hidden even though
the operating system is otherwise in scope.

## Integration Contract

DeepChat must continue to own the integration boundary:

- The official plugin manifest or discovery layer declares the supported platform/arch targets and
  bundled runtime candidates.
- The driver binary is started by DeepChat's plugin host through the existing plugin tool server
  path.
- The user-facing capability remains "skill + built-in tool surface" inside DeepChat.
- The implementation may keep the internal stdio server transport, but it must not require users
  to configure or install an external MCP server.
- Runtime detection must prefer plugin-local binaries and only use external fallback candidates for
  diagnostics or development.

## Upstream Runtime Contract

Pin the CUA runtime to a specific upstream release:

- Tag: `cua-driver-rs-v0.7.1`.
- Commit: `7caf72bee2286f47a985c3121b56aaabdebd62b9`.
- Version: `0.7.1`.

The build step must stage release artifacts instead of relying on local Swift-only source builds.
Every staged asset must be validated before packaging:

- Download the expected release archive for the target platform and arch.
- Verify it against the upstream `checksums.txt` asset.
- Validate required files exist after extraction.
- Normalize executable permissions on POSIX targets.
- Validate the driver can be executed for a low-risk command such as `--version` when the host
  platform and runtime loader can run the target binary.
- Keep macOS signing and helper-app validation in place where a `.app` bundle is staged.

## Runtime Layout

The packaged plugin should stage only the target runtime needed by the artifact being built:

```text
plugins/cua/runtime/
  darwin/
    arm64/
      DeepChat Computer Use.app/Contents/MacOS/deepchat-cua-driver
    x64/
      DeepChat Computer Use.app/Contents/MacOS/deepchat-cua-driver
  win32/
    x64/
      cua-driver.exe
      cua-driver-uia.exe
    arm64/
      cua-driver.exe
      cua-driver-uia.exe
  linux/
    x64/
      cua-driver
```

The macOS app directory is `DeepChat Computer Use.app` and the executable is
`deepchat-cua-driver`, so packaged DeepChat does not collide with upstream `CuaDriver.app` while
still consuming verified upstream release artifacts.

## Tool Surface

The plugin policy and skill docs must match upstream v0.7.1 tool names.

Removed or renamed assumptions:

- Do not expose `screenshot` as the primary capture tool. Upstream uses `get_window_state` with a
  vision capture mode.
- Do not rely on `set_recording`. Recording is split into `start_recording`,
  `stop_recording`, `get_recording_state`, `replay_trajectory`, and `install_ffmpeg`.

Core tools expected across supported platforms include:

- App and window discovery: `list_apps`, `list_windows`, `get_window_state`,
  `get_accessibility_tree`.
- App and window actions: `launch_app`, `kill_app`, `bring_to_front`.
- Input actions: `click`, `double_click`, `right_click`, `drag`, `scroll`, `type_text`,
  `press_key`, `hotkey`, `set_value`.
- Cursor tools: `get_screen_size`, `get_cursor_position`, `move_cursor`,
  `set_agent_cursor_enabled`, `set_agent_cursor_motion`, `set_agent_cursor_style`,
  `get_agent_cursor_state`.
- Configuration and permissions: `check_permissions`, `get_config`, `set_config`,
  `check_for_update`.
- Session and recording lifecycle: `start_session`, `end_session`, `start_recording`,
  `stop_recording`, `get_recording_state`, `replay_trajectory`, `install_ffmpeg`.

Platform-specific tools may exist, such as Linux mouse-button primitives and Windows diagnostic
tools. Policies must classify these explicitly instead of leaving them to default approval rules.

## Permission and Safety Requirements

Tool policies must be exact and conservative:

- Read-only discovery and status tools may be allowed automatically.
- User-visible input, app launch, app termination, window focus, recording, replay, config
  mutation, and dependency installation must require user approval.
- Any newly detected upstream tool without a policy must be treated as a review failure in tests.

Platform permission behavior must be explicit:

- macOS keeps accessibility and screen-capture permission checks and helper-app permission UX.
- Windows must not show macOS TCC-specific instructions.
- Linux must communicate pre-release constraints and compositor/session limitations without
  blocking supported tool startup when the driver reports usable status.

## Packaging Requirements

The packaged app must keep CUA usable after Electron packaging:

- The `.dcplugin` artifact must contain the correct runtime subtree for its platform and arch.
- The packaged `.dcplugin` manifest must narrow `engines.targets` to the artifact's own
  platform/arch target, even though the source manifest keeps the full supported target matrix.
- Runtime files must stay outside `app.asar`.
- Supported Windows archives must include `cua-driver-uia.exe` next to `cua-driver.exe`.
- Linux runtime files must retain executable permissions after package extraction.
- macOS helper bundles must pass bundle path, executable, and signing validation.
- `plugin:verify` must be able to verify CUA artifacts per supported platform and arch.
- CI and release workflows must bundle and verify CUA for supported Windows, macOS, and Linux
  build targets.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Official CUA plugin metadata or discovery logic allows only the supported target matrix:
  `darwin/arm64`, `darwin/x64`, `win32/x64`, `win32/arm64`, and `linux/x64`.
- Each target-specific CUA `.dcplugin` advertises only its own `engines.targets` entry, so
  side-by-side artifacts cannot be selected on the wrong CPU architecture.
- Packaged macOS, Windows, and Linux x64 builds include a CUA `.dcplugin` artifact.
- Packaged Windows arm64 builds include a CUA `.dcplugin` artifact.
- Packaged Linux arm64 builds do not include a visible or usable CUA plugin.
- Direct CUA runtime packaging for Linux arm64 fails with a clear unsupported-target message.
- Official plugin visibility is gated by platform and arch, so the unsupported Linux arm target does
  not show CUA as available.
- Unsupported sibling artifacts for the same plugin id are ignored during discovery without
  disabling or uninstalling an installed artifact that supports the current target.
- The settings sidebar and settings routes expose the Plugins entry on supported CUA targets, not
  only on macOS, while keeping unsupported CUA targets hidden.
- Runtime detection resolves the plugin-local binary on every supported target.
- The plugin starts through DeepChat's internal tool path without user-managed MCP setup.
- Optional MCP capabilities not implemented by the CUA driver, such as prompts and resources, are
  treated as absent capabilities and must not produce error-level log spam.
- Skill docs describe DeepChat usage and platform caveats, not upstream manual installer workflows.
- Tool policies cover all upstream v0.7.1 tools known to this integration.
- Packaging docs and tests no longer describe CUA as macOS-only.
- Build, lint, i18n, and focused test suites pass after implementation.

## Risks

- Upstream release archive layouts may change. The staging script must validate layout and fail
  closed.
- Cross-compiling the Rust driver locally is higher risk than consuming verified release assets.
  The first implementation should prefer release assets.
- macOS helper-app rename or re-signing can break permissions. The implementation must verify the
  staged bundle after any mutation.
- Linux support is upstream pre-release. DeepChat should support the available asset while keeping
  limitations visible and testable.
- Tool names changed from the Swift-era integration. Missing policy updates could silently approve
  or block the wrong tools.
