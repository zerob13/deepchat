## Validation Result

- Focused provider, agent, shared, contract, and renderer suites passed; the final provider-model
  helper suite passed all 18 tests after the cache-path optimization.
- `pnpm run format`, `pnpm run i18n`, and `pnpm run lint` passed.
- `pnpm run typecheck` passed both node and renderer type checking.
- `pnpm test` passed 636 files with 19 skipped; 6,654 tests passed with 241 skipped.
- `pnpm run build` passed and refreshed the provider and ACP registry resources.
- The refreshed provider database contains 175 providers and 7,728 models. Both Moonshot K3
  records retain `temperature: false` and the complete reasoning portrait required by this
  specification.
- Post-review focused provider, runtime, helper, renderer, agent, contract, and wire suites passed.
  The final K3 wire matrix covers canonical, free, coding, coding-free, and separator-normalized
  aliases.
- The post-review full suite passed 637 files with 19 skipped; 6,674 tests passed with 241 skipped,
  including the expanded seven-case reasoning wire suite.
- Post-review `pnpm run format`, `pnpm run i18n`, `pnpm run lint`, full type checking, and
  `pnpm run build` passed. The build refreshed the expected ACP registry entry for Harn 0.10.41;
  provider-db content remained stable.
- The final severity-ordered review found and fixed a cache-state-dependent route metadata source,
  replacing derived array scans with a compact raw O(1) route index shared by runtime and settings.
  No remaining high, medium, or low-severity findings were identified.
- Renderer convergence focused validation passed 8 files and 204 tests across request policy,
  capability identity, final AI SDK serialization, the shared renderer projection, and all three
  renderer entry points.
- The final full suite passed 638 files with 19 skipped; 6,693 tests passed with 241 skipped.
- Renderer convergence formatting, i18n validation, lint, full type checking, and the production
  build passed. The build refreshed the expected Claude Agent ACP registry entry from 0.62.0 to
  0.63.0; provider-db content remained stable.
- The severity-ordered renderer review found and fixed one medium-severity stale-identity window
  that could enable saving a renamed custom model against the prior capability snapshot, and one
  low-severity overbroad shared-helper name. No remaining findings were identified.

## Silent capability failure presentation

- [x] Replace the user-facing capability error and retry control with silent generation-control
      hiding.
- [x] Preserve internal error and failed query identity without synthesizing passthrough.
- [x] Keep unrelated model configuration saveable after a settled current-query failure.
- [x] Remove obsolete capability-error translations and retry UI.
- [x] Update renderer regressions for silent failure behavior.
- [x] Run focused and required repository validation.
- [x] Review the complete diff by severity, fix findings, and commit without pushing.

### Validation result

- `pnpm run format`: passed on 2318 files.
- `pnpm run i18n`: no missing keys or invalid translations.
- `pnpm run lint`: passed, including the agent cleanup guard.
- `pnpm run typecheck`: node and renderer checks passed.
- `pnpm run test:renderer`: 199 files and 1586 tests passed.
- Focused composable and three-consumer failure suite: 119 tests passed, including the added direct
  ChatStatusBar coverage.
- The severity-ordered review found and closed one low-severity consumer coverage gap. No remaining
  correctness, compatibility, security, performance, naming, or maintenance findings were
  identified.

  and diff whitespace checks passed.
- The compatibility review retained legacy video detection and New API precedence, rejected
  speculative request fallback and cache changes, and found no remaining correctness, security,
  performance, naming, or maintenance issue in the final patch.
